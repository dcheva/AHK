<h1>#UseHook</h1>

<p>Forces the use of the  hook to implement all or some keyboard <a href="../Hotkeys.html">hotkeys</a>.</p>

<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">#UseHook</span> <span class="optional">OnOff</span></pre>
<h2 id="Parameters">Parameters</h2>
<dl>

  <dt>OnOff</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If omitted, it defaults to <em>On</em>. Otherwise, specify one of the following words:</p>
    <p><strong>On:</strong> The <a href="_InstallKeybdHook.html">keyboard hook</a> will be used to implement all keyboard hotkeys between here and the next <code>#UseHook Off</code> (if any).</p>
    <p><strong>Off:</strong> Hotkeys will be implemented using the default method (RegisterHotkey() if possible; otherwise, the keyboard hook).</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>If this directive is unspecified in the script, it will behave as though set to <em>Off</em>, meaning the windows API function RegisterHotkey() is used to implement a keyboard hotkey whenever possible. However, the responsiveness of hotkeys might be better under some conditions if the <a href="_InstallKeybdHook.html">keyboard hook</a> is used instead.</p>
<p>Turning this directive ON is equivalent to using the <a href="../Hotkeys.html#prefixdollar">$ prefix</a> in the definition of each affected hotkey.</p>
<p>As with all # directives -- which are processed only once when the script is launched --  <code>#UseHook</code> should not be positioned in the script as though it were a command (that is, it is not necessary to have it contained within a subroutine). Instead, position it immediately before the first hotkey label you wish to have affected by it.</p>
<p>By default, hotkeys that use the <a href="_InstallKeybdHook.html">keyboard hook</a> cannot be triggered by means of the <a href="Send.html">Send</a> command. Similarly, mouse hotkeys cannot be triggered by commands such as <a href="Click.html">Click</a> because all mouse hotkeys use the <a href="_InstallMouseHook.html">mouse hook</a>. One workaround is to use <a href="Gosub.html">Gosub</a> to jump directly to the hotkey's subroutine. For example: <code>Gosub #LButton</code>.</p>
<p><span class="ver">[v1.1.06+]</span>: <a href="_InputLevel.html">#InputLevel</a> and <a href="SendLevel.html">SendLevel</a> provide additional control over which hotkeys and hotstrings are triggered by the Send command.</p>
<p>If this directive does not appear in the script at all, it will behave as though set to OFF.</p>
<p>Like other directives, #UseHook cannot be executed conditionally.</p>
