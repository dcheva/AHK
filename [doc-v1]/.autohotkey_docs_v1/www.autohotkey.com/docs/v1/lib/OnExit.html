<h1>OnExit</h1>
<p>OnExit can be used as a <a href="#function">function</a> or <a href="#command">command</a>, although the former is recommended for new scripts. As a function, it registers a <em>function</em> to be called automatically whenever the script exits. As a command, it registers a <em>subroutine</em> to be called automatically whenever the script exits.</p>

<h2 id="function">OnExit Function <span class="ver">[v1.1.20+]</span></h2>
<p>Registers a <a href="../Functions.html">function</a> to be called automatically whenever the script exits.</p>
<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">OnExit</span>(Callback <span class="optional">, AddRemove</span>)</pre>

<h3 id="Function_Parameters">Parameters</h3>
<dl>

  <dt>Callback</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>A function name or <a href="../misc/Functor.html">function object</a> to call. To pass a literal function name, enclose it in quotes.</p>
    <p>The callback accepts two parameters and can be <a href="../Functions.html#intro">defined</a> as follows:</p>
    <pre class="NoIndent">MyCallback(ExitReason, ExitCode) { ...</pre>
    <p>Although the names you give the parameters do not matter, the following values are sequentially assigned to them:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The exit reason (one of the words from the <a href="#ExitReason">table below</a>).</li>
      <li>The exit code passed to <a href="Exit.html">Exit</a> or <a href="ExitApp.html">ExitApp</a>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>You can omit one or more parameters from the end of the callback's parameter list if the corresponding information is not needed.</p>
    <p>The callback can return a non-zero integer to prevent the script from exiting (with some <a href="#close">rare exceptions</a>) and calling more callbacks. Otherwise, the script exits after all registered callbacks are called.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>AddRemove</dt>
  <dd><p>If omitted, it defaults to 1. Otherwise, specify one of the following numbers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1 = Call the callback after any previously registered callbacks.</li>
      <li>-1 = Call the callback before any previously registered callbacks.</li>
      <li>0 = Do not call the callback.</li>
    </ul>
  <p>If a subroutine has been registered by the <a href="#command">OnExit command</a> below, that subroutine is always called first.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

<h3 id="Function_Remarks">Remarks</h3>
<p>Any number of callbacks can be registered. If a subroutine is also registered (by the <a href="#command">OnExit command</a> below), the callbacks are called after the subroutine calls <a href="ExitApp.html">ExitApp</a>. A callback usually should not call ExitApp; if it does, the script terminates immediately.</p>

<h2 id="command">OnExit Command</h2>
<p>Registers a <a href="../Language.html#subroutines">subroutine</a> to be called automatically whenever the script exits.</p>
<p class="warning"><strong>Deprecated:</strong> This command is not recommended for use in new scripts. Use the <a href="#function">OnExit</a> function described above instead to reduce the risk of accidentally creating a script which can't be exited, and ensures that the exit code passed to <a href="Exit.html">Exit</a> or <a href="ExitApp.html">ExitApp</a> is preserved.</p>
<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">OnExit</span> <span class="optional">, Label</span></pre>

<h3 id="Command_Parameters">Parameters</h3>
<dl>

  <dt>Label</dt>
  <dd><p>If blank or omitted, any previously registered subroutine is unregistered. Otherwise, specify the <a href="../misc/Labels.html">label</a> of the subroutine whose contents will be executed (as a new <a href="../misc/Threads.html">thread</a>) when the script exits by any means.</p></dd>
  
</dl>

<h3 id="Command_Remarks">Remarks</h3>
<p>Since the registered subroutine is called instead of terminating the script, that subroutine must use <a href="ExitApp.html">ExitApp</a> if termination is desired.</p>
<p>The built-in variable <strong>A_ExitReason</strong> is blank unless the registered subroutine is currently running or has been called at least once by a prior exit attempt. If not blank, it is one of the words from the <a href="#ExitReason">table below</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>The callback or subroutine is called when the script exits by any means (except when it is killed by something like "End Task"). It is also called whenever <a href="_SingleInstance.html">#SingleInstance</a> and <a href="Reload.html">Reload</a> ask a previous instance to terminate.</p>
<p>A script can detect and optionally abort a system shutdown or logoff via <code>OnMessage(0x0011, "WM_QUERYENDSESSION")</code> (see <a href="OnMessage.html#shutdown">OnMessage example #2</a> for a working script).</p>
<p>The OnExit <a href="../misc/Threads.html">thread</a> does not obey <a href="_MaxThreads.html">#MaxThreads</a> (it will always launch when needed). In addition, while it is running, it cannot be interrupted by any <a href="../misc/Threads.html">thread</a>, including <a href="../Hotkeys.html">hotkeys</a>, <a href="Menu.html">custom menu items</a>, and <a href="SetTimer.html">timed subroutines</a>. However, it will be interrupted (and the script will terminate) if the user chooses Exit from the tray menu or main menu, or the script is asked to terminate as a result of <a href="Reload.html">Reload</a> or <a href="_SingleInstance.html">#SingleInstance</a>. Because of this, the callback or subroutine should be designed to finish quickly unless the user is aware of what it is doing.</p>
<p>If the OnExit <a href="../misc/Threads.html">thread</a> encounters a failure condition such as a runtime error, the script will terminate. This prevents a flawed callback or subroutine from making a script impossible to terminate.</p>
<p>If the OnExit <a href="../misc/Threads.html">thread</a> was launched due to <a href="Exit.html">Exit</a> or <a href="ExitApp.html">ExitApp</a> that specified an exit code, in v1.1.19 and earlier that code is ignored and no longer available. In <span class="ver">[v1.1.20+]</span> the initial exit code is used unless overridden by calling <a href="ExitApp.html">ExitApp</a> with a new exit code.</p>
<p>Whenever an exit attempt is made, each callback or subroutine starts off fresh with the default values for settings such as <a href="SendMode.html">SendMode</a>. These defaults can be changed in the <a href="../Scripts.html#auto">auto-execute section</a>.</p>

      <p>The script was sent a WM_CLOSE or WM_QUIT message, had a critical error, or is being closed in some other way. Although all of these are unusual, WM_CLOSE might be caused by <a href="WinClose.html">WinClose</a> having been used on the script's main window. To close (hide) the window without terminating the script, use <a href="WinHide.html">WinHide</a>.</p>
      <p>If the script is exiting due to a critical error or its <a href="../Program.html#main-window">main window</a> being destroyed, it will unconditionally terminate after the OnExit thread completes.</p>
      <p>If the main window is being destroyed, it may still exist but cannot be displayed. This condition can be detected by monitoring the WM_DESTROY message with <a href="OnMessage.html">OnMessage()</a>.</p>
