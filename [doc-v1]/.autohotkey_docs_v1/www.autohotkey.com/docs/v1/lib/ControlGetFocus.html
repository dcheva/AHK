<h1>ControlGetFocus</h1>

<p>Retrieves which control of the target window has input focus, if any.</p>

<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">ControlGetFocus</span>, OutputVar <span class="optional">, WinTitle, WinText, ExcludeTitle, ExcludeText</span></pre>
<h2 id="Parameters">Parameters</h2>
<dl>

  <dt>OutputVar</dt>
  <dd><p>The name of the output variable in which to store the identifier of the control, which consists of its classname followed by its sequence number within its parent window, e.g. Button12.</p></dd>

  <dt>WinTitle, WinText, ExcludeTitle, ExcludeText</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If each of these is blank or omitted, the <a href="../misc/WinTitle.html#LastFoundWindow">Last Found Window</a> will be used. Otherwise, specify for <em>WinTitle</em> a <a href="../misc/WinTitle.html">window title or other criteria</a> to identify the target window and/or for <em>WinText</em> a substring from a single text element of the target window (as revealed by the included Window Spy utility).</p>
    <p><em>ExcludeTitle</em> and <em>ExcludeText</em> can be used to exclude one or more windows by their title or text. Their specification is similar to <em>WinTitle</em> and <em>WinText</em>, except that <em>ExcludeTitle</em> does not recognize any criteria other than the window title.</p>
    <p>Window titles and text are case-sensitive. By default, hidden windows are not detected and hidden text elements are detected, unless changed with <a href="DetectHiddenWindows.html">DetectHiddenWindows</a> and <a href="DetectHiddenText.html">DetectHiddenText</a>. By default, a window title must start with the specified <em>WinTitle</em> or <em>ExcludeTitle</em> to be a match, unless changed with <a href="SetTitleMatchMode.html">SetTitleMatchMode</a>.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

<h2 id="Error_Handling">Error Handling</h2>
<p><span class="ver">[v1.1.04+]</span>: This command is able to throw an exception on failure. For more information, see <a href="Catch.html#RuntimeErrors">Runtime Errors</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../misc/ErrorLevel.html">ErrorLevel</a> is set to 0 if the control with input focus was successfully retrieved. Otherwise (e.g. the target window doesn't exist or none of its controls have input focus) it will be set to 1.</p>
<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>The control retrieved by this command is the one that has keyboard focus, that is, the one that would receive keystrokes if the user were to type any.</p>
<p>The target window must be active to have a focused control. If the window is not active, <em>OutputVar</em> will be made blank.</p>
<p>Prior to <span class="ver">[v1.1.19.03]</span>, if ControlGetFocus was executed repeatedly at a high frequency (i.e. every 500&nbsp;ms or faster), it usually disrupted the user's ability to double-click. This has been fixed.</p>
