<h1>FileSelectFile</h1>

<p>Displays a standard dialog that allows the user to open or save file(s).</p>

<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">FileSelectFile</span>, OutputVar <span class="optional">, Options, RootDir\Filename, Title, Filter</span></pre>
<h2 id="Parameters">Parameters</h2>
<dl>

  <dt>OutputVar</dt>
  <dd><p>The name of the output variable in which to store the filename(s) selected by the user. This will be made blank if the user cancels the dialog (i.e. does not wish to select a file).</p></dd>

  <dt>Options</dt>
  <dd><p>If blank or omitted, it defaults to zero, which is the same as having none of the options below. Otherwise, specify a number or one of the letters listed below, optionally followed by a number. For example, <code class="no-highlight">M</code>, <code class="no-highlight">1</code> and <code class="no-highlight">M1</code> are all valid (but not equivalent).</p>
      <p><strong>M:</strong> Multi-select. Specify the letter M to allow the user to select more than one file via shift-click, control-click, or other means. To extract the individual files, see the example at the bottom of this page.</p>
      <p><strong>S:</strong> Save dialog. Specify the letter S to cause the dialog to always contain a Save button instead of an Open button.</p>
      <p>The following numbers can be used. To put more than one of them into effect, add them up. For example, to use 1 and 2, specify the number 3.</p>
      <p><strong>1:</strong> File Must Exist<br>
        <strong>2:</strong> Path Must Exist<br>
        <strong>8:</strong> Prompt to Create New File<br>
        <strong>16:</strong> Prompt to Overwrite File<br>
        <strong>32</strong> <span class="ver">[v1.0.43.09+]</span>:
        Shortcuts (.lnk files) are selected as-is rather than being resolved to their targets. This option also prevents navigation into a folder via a folder shortcut.</p>
      <p>As the "Prompt to Overwrite" option is supported only by the Save dialog, specifying that option without the "Prompt to Create" option also puts the S option into effect. Similarly, the "Prompt to Create" option has no effect when the S option is present. Specifying the number 24 enables whichever type of prompt is supported by the dialog.</p></dd>

  <dt>RootDir\Filename</dt>
  <dd><p>If blank or omitted, the starting directory will be a default that might depend on the OS version (it will likely be the directory most recently selected by the user during a prior use of FileSelectFile). Otherwise, specify one or both of the following:</p>
      <p><strong>RootDir:</strong> The root (starting) directory, which is assumed to be a subfolder in <a href="../Variables.html#WorkingDir">%A_WorkingDir%</a> if an absolute path is not specified. <span class="ver">[v1.0.43.10+]</span>: On Windows XP/2003 and earlier, a <a href="../misc/CLSID-List.html">CLSID</a> such as <code class="no-highlight">::{20D04FE0-3AEA-1069-A2D8-08002B30309D}</code> (i.e. This PC; formerly My Computer or Computer) may also be specified, in which case any subdirectory present after the CLSID should end in a backslash (otherwise, the string after the last backslash will be interpreted as the default filename, below).</p>
      <p><strong>Filename:</strong> The default filename to initially show in the dialog's edit field. Only the naked filename (with no path) will be shown. To ensure that the dialog is properly shown, ensure that no illegal characters are present (such as <code>/&lt;|:"</code>).</p>
      <p>Examples:</p>
      <pre class="no-highlight">C:\My Pictures\Default Image Name.gif  <em>; Both <i>RootDir</i> and <i>Filename</i> are present.</em>
C:\My Pictures  <em>; Only <i>RootDir</i> is present.</em>
My Pictures  <em>; Only <i>RootDir</i> is present, and it's relative to the current working directory.</em>
My File  <em>; Only <i>Filename</i> is present (but if "My File" exists as a folder, it is assumed to be <i>RootDir</i>).</em></pre></dd>

  <dt>Title</dt>
  <dd><p>If blank or omitted, it defaults to <code>Select File - %A_ScriptName%</code> (i.e. the name of the current script). Otherwise, specify the title of the file-selection window.</p></dd>

  <dt>Filter</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If blank or omitted, the dialog will show all type of files and provide the options "All Files (*.*)" and "Text Documents (*.txt)" in the "Files of type" drop-down list.</p>
    <p>Otherwise, specify a string to indicate which types of files are shown by the dialog, e.g. <code>Documents (*.txt)</code>. To include more than one file extension in the filter, separate them with semicolons, e.g. <code>Audio (*.wav; *.mp2; *.mp3)</code>. In this case, the "Files of type" drop-down list has the specified string and "All Files (*.*)" as options.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

<h2 id="Error_Handling">Error Handling</h2>
<p><span class="ver">[v1.1.04+]</span>: This command is able to throw an exception on failure. For more information, see <a href="Catch.html#RuntimeErrors">Runtime Errors</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../misc/ErrorLevel.html">ErrorLevel</a> is set to 1 if the user dismissed the dialog without selecting a file (such as by pressing the Cancel button). It is also set to 1 if the system refused to show the dialog (rare). Otherwise, it is set to 0.</p>
<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>A file-selection dialog usually looks like this:</p>
<img src="../static/dlg_file.png" alt="FileSelectFile" />
<p>If the user didn't select anything (e.g. pressed CANCEL), <em>OutputVar</em> is made blank.</p>
<p>If multi-select is not in effect, <em>OutputVar</em> is set to the full path and name of the single file chosen by the user.</p>
<p>If the M option (multi-select) is in effect, <em>OutputVar</em> is set to a list of items, each of which except the last is followed by a linefeed (`n) character. The first item in the list is the path that contains all the selected files (this path will end in a backslash only if it is a root folder such as C:\). The other items are the selected filenames (without path). For example:</p>
<pre class="no-highlight">C:\My Documents\New Folder [this is the path in which all the files below reside]
test1.txt [these are the naked filenames: no path info]
test2.txt
... etc.</pre>
<p>(The example at the bottom of this page demonstrates how to extract the files one by one.)</p>
<p>When multi-select is in effect, the sum of the lengths of the selected filenames is limited to 64 KB. Although this is typically enough to hold several thousand files, <em>OutputVar</em> will be made blank if the limit is exceeded.</p>
<p>A GUI window may display a modal file-selection dialog by means of <a href="Gui.html#OwnDialogs">Gui +OwnDialogs</a>. A modal dialog prevents the user from interacting with the GUI window until the dialog is dismissed.</p>
<p><span class="ver">[v1.0.25.06+]</span>: The multi-select option "4" is obsolete. However, for compatibility with older scripts, it still functions as it did before. Specifically, if the user selects only one file, <em>OutputVar</em> will contain its full path and name followed by a linefeed (`n) character. If the user selects more than one file, the format is the same as that of the M option described above, except that the last item also ends in a linefeed (`n).</p>
