<h1>#MaxThreadsBuffer</h1>

<p>Causes some or all <a href="../Hotkeys.html">hotkeys</a> to buffer rather than ignore keypresses when their <a href="_MaxThreadsPerHotkey.html">#MaxThreadsPerHotkey</a> limit has been reached.</p>

<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">#MaxThreadsBuffer</span> OnOff</pre>
<h2 id="Parameters">Parameters</h2>
<dl>

  <dt>OnOff</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Specify one of the following words:</p>
    <p><strong>On:</strong> All hotkey subroutines between here and the next <code>#MaxThreadsBuffer Off</code> directive will buffer rather than ignore presses of their hotkeys whenever their subroutines are at their <a href="_MaxThreadsPerHotkey.html">#MaxThreadsPerHotkey</a> limit.</p>
    <p><strong>Off:</strong> A hotkey press will be ignored whenever that hotkey is already running its maximum number of threads (usually 1, but this can be changed with <a href="_MaxThreadsPerHotkey.html">#MaxThreadsPerHotkey</a>).</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>If this directive is unspecified in the script, it will behave as though set to <em>Off</em>.</p>
<p>This directive is rarely used because this type of buffering usually does more harm than good. For example, if you accidentally press a hotkey twice, having this setting ON would cause that hotkey's subroutine to automatically run a second time if its first <a href="../misc/Threads.html">thread</a> takes less than 1 second to finish (this type of buffer expires after 1 second, by design). Note that AutoHotkey  buffers hotkeys in several other ways (such as <a href="Thread.html#Interrupt">Thread Interrupt</a> and <a href="Critical.html">Critical</a>). It's just that this particular way can be detrimental, thus it is OFF by default.</p>
<p>The main use for this directive is to increase the responsiveness of the keyboard's auto-repeat feature. For example, when you hold down a hotkey whose <a href="_MaxThreadsPerHotkey.html">#MaxThreadsPerHotkey</a> setting is 1 (the default), incoming keypresses  are ignored if that hotkey subroutine is already running. Thus, when the subroutine finishes, it must wait for the next auto-repeat keypress to come in, which might take 50&nbsp;ms or more due to being caught in between keystrokes of the auto-repeat cycle. This 50&nbsp;ms delay can be avoided by enabling this directive for any hotkey that needs the best possible response time while it is being auto-repeated.</p>
<p>As with all # directives, this one should not be positioned in the script as though it were a command (i.e. it is not necessary to have it contained within a subroutine). Instead, position it immediately before the first hotkey label you wish to have affected by it.</p>
<p>Like other directives, #MaxThreadsBuffer cannot be executed conditionally.</p>
